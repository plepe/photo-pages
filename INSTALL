Skunk photo pages
-----------------

See also the README-file for more information about this project.

Installation
------------
  Install the scripts to a directory, that is reachable for your webserver
  (e.g. apache). It needs PHP to run, no database servers are used.

  Create a directory where your images will be put. This directory shouldn't be
  reachable via your webserver (for security-reasons). It has to be writeable
  for the webserver (you won't be able to edit your photopages).
  Copy all files from the templates-directory to this directory.
  See below for a description of these files.

  Create a second directory (the upload directory), where you can put images
  for the photopages, that can be imported (via the "Upload pictures"-Page).

  Copy conf.php-dist to conf.php and fill with correct values.

  Type the address of your new photopages into the address bar of your
  preferred browser. You should be able to login as user 'admin' and password
  'admin'.

Dependencies
------------
  The Photo Pages use other software for image operations.
  - php (>= 4.3)
  - ImageMagick
  - exiftran
  - ffmpeg (to transcode videos)
for future release:  - flvtool2 (to add metadata to videos)

Upgrading
---------
  Save the conf.php, get rid of the old installation and copy conf.php back to
  the new installation. Check this section of this file for changes to the
  conf.php.
