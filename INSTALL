Skunk photo pages
-----------------

Also see the README-file for more information about this project.

Installation
------------
  Install the scripts to a directory that is reachable for your webserver
  (e.g. apache). It needs PHP to run, no database servers are used.
    cd ~/public_html OR cd /var/www                     ; go to html-space
    tar xzf /path/to/download/photo-current.tgz         ; unpack the archive
    cd photos                                           ; change to script files

  Create a directory where your images will be put. This directory shouldn't be
  reachable via your webserver (for security-reasons). It has to be writeable
  for the webserver (or you won't be able to edit your photopages).
  Then copy all files from the templates-directory to this directory:
    mkdir /path/to/your/photos                          ; creates the directory
    cp templates/* /path/to/your/photos                 ; copies the templates
    chmod a+w -R /path/to/your/photos                   ; directory writeable

  See below for a description of these files.

  Create a second directory (the upload directory), where you can put images
  for the photopages, that can be imported (via the "Upload pictures"-Page).
    mkdir /path/to/upload_dir                           ; creates dir

  Copy conf.php-dist to conf.php and fill in the correct values.
    cp conf.php-dist conf.php                           ; copies config
    nano conf.php                                       ; edit config

  Type the address of your new photopages into the address bar of your
  preferred browser. You should be able to login as user 'admin' and password
  'admin'.
  If you've unpacked the photo pages to your public_html-directory, the address
  would be http://your.domain/~username/photos . In /var/www the address would
  be http://your.domain/photos . In the very likely case that your
  webserver-configuration is different consult the documenation of your
  distribution or ask a sysadmin.

Dependencies
------------
  The Photo Pages use other software for image operations.
  - php (>= 4.3)
  - ImageMagick
  - exiftran
  - ffmpeg (to transcode videos)
for future release:  - flvtool2 (to add metadata to videos)

Upgrading
---------
  Save the conf.php, get rid of the old installation and copy conf.php back to
  the new installation. Check this section of this file for changes to the
  conf.php.

  Version >= r54
  --------------
  - Extension-system. Add a variable $extensions to conf.php to include
    extensions (see conf.php-dist resp. README)

  Version >= r41
  --------------
  - URLs have a new syntax. Please look at the lines in the
    conf.php-dist and update your conf.php accordingly

  Version >= r73
  --------------
  - Changed encoding from ISO-8859-15 to UTF-8. So please recode all your
    fotocfg.txt and *.lst to UTF-8 (you can use recode: 'recode
    iso8859-15..utf-8 fotocfg.txt')
