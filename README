  If you think this software is cool and fancy, then please write me. If you've
  got ideas for improvements, then don't hesitate and write me. I'd also

    Has a similar script and I copied the original format of fotocfg.txt from
    him. And he keeps poking me to write documentation.

  Alex "Asgaard" Piskernik
    keeps telling me, that my code is easily readable. So it's his fault if you
    find not enough comments ;)
