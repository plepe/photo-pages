  The original version of these photo pages were started in 1998. It has been
  rewritten several times, though the version number 4.

  If you want to contact the author, it's Stephan Plepelits from Vienna, Austria.
  You can send me e-mail via skunk@xover.mud.at.
  There's also a homepage to this project: http://xover.mud.at/~skunk/photo_pages/

  If you think this software is cool and fancy, then please write me. If you've
  got ideas for improvements, then don't hesitate and write me. I'd also
  appreciate your bits of code, that could improve this software. Your name in
  the Acknowledgement-Section of this file is guaranted (if I can use it).

Files in templates/
-------------------
- fotocfg.txt

  There's a short description in the file DOCU.

- passwd / group
  You can use the program htpasswd to change passwords and add users.
  Type 'htpasswd /path/to/passwd username' to change a password or create a new
  user.

  In the group-file you can add users to a group. Each line starts with the
  name of a group, followed by a : and a space-seperated list of users:

  Andreas "Andyl" Weiner
    Has a similar script and I copied the original format of fotocfg.txt from
    him. And he keeps poking me to write documentation.

  Alex "Asgaard" Piskernik
    keeps telling me, that my code is easily readable. So it's his fault if you
    find not enough comments ;)
