INSTALLATION

  Install the scripts to a directory, that is reachable for your webserver
  (e.g. apache).

  Create a directory where your images will be put. This directory shouldn't be
  reachable via your webserver (for security-reasons). It should be writeable
  for the webserver (so you won't be able to edit your photopages).

CREATING A PHOTOPAGE
Using the shell
---------------
1) Create a subdirectory, where the pictures shall reside
1) Copy all photos in high resolution to the subdirectory orig/
2) Start mk_photopage (this will take some minutes)
   This will create the directories 600/ and 200/ (or others, see conf.php)
   and put rescaled versions of all the images there
   as last part it will create a fotocfg.txt
4) Edit fotocfg.txt
   - You can put comments to your pictures:
     "photo_1.jpg This is Picture one."
   - You can put text there, according to "DOCU"
5) Ready.

Using the webpage
-----------------
1) Log in with a user that may create pages
2) Click on "Edit Page".
3) Drop a new subdirectory to your current page
4) Enter the data
5) Save
6) Go to the newly create page, use "Upload images" to upload images. This can
   take a little while, the images will be scaled to the other resolutions.
