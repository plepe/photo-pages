INSTALLATION

  Install the scripts to a directory, that is reachable for your webserver
  (e.g. apache).

  Create a directory where your images will be put. This directory shouldn't be
  reachable via your webserver (for security-reasons). It has to be writeable
  for the webserver (you won't be able to edit your photopages).
  Copy the files passwd and group from the templates-directory to this directory.
  See below for a description of these files.

  Create a second directory (the upload directory), where you can put images
  for the photopages, that can be imported (via the "Upload pictures"-Page).

  Copy conf.php-dist to conf.php and fill with correct values.

  Type the address of your new photopages into the address bar of your
  preferred browser. You should be able to login as user 'admin' and password
  'admin'.

passwd / group
--------------
  You can use the program htpasswd to change passwords and add users.
  Type 'htpasswd /path/to/passwd username' to change a password or create a new
  user.

  In the group-file you can add users to a group. Each line starts with the
  name of a group, followed by a : and a space-seperated list of users:
  groupname:user1 user2 user3
